# terraria-epic-Verision

a terraria mod i made with a bunch of random stuff in it.

i think i have ryuji, akihiko, aigis, neco arc, nanako (kinda) and goku

if you wanna make high resolution textures for npcs, i figured out a way to do it and it doesn't look horrible so check the code for that i guess
